# Deep_Learning_CNN


This project entails constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 3-channel color images sized 32x32 pixels, categorized into ten classes. Tasks include detailing the CNN's architecture, layers, filters/kernels, and design decisions, visualizing the loss function for training and validation sets, implementing overfitting prevention techniques, and calculating weights after each CNN layer.
